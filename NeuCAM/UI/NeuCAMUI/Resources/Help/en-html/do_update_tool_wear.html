<div id="do_update_tool_wear"><p>Specifies whether to update the tool-wear compensation stored in the controller of the machine tool.</p>
<p>Tools wear away as they are used. The physical size of the tool gets smaller and the edge of the cutter becomes blunt causing deflection. Updating the compensation counteracts tool wear, so that subsequent machining operations remain accurate.</p>
