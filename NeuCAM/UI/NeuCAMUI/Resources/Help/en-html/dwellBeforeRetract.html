<div id="dwellBeforeRetract"><p>Select to specfiy the amount of time to dwell before making the retract move, for the Chip Break Distance. This keeps the bottom of the hole smooth for when the tool returns on the next peck.</p>
<p>Typically a dwelling time between 1/4 second and 1 second is sufficient.</p>
<p>Example: To dwell for 1/4 second, specify 0.25 or 1/4 in this field.</p>
<p>When post processing a drill cycle, the dwell time is specified as one of the drill cycle parameters (typically P), and in most cases it is output in milliseconds (ms).</p>
