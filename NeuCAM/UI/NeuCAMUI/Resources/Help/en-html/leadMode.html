<div id="leadMode"><p>The lead mode settings provide very specific control of the leads. There are five options available.</p>
<p><b>Fail</b> - Results in a failure if it is not possible to do the lead in/outs without causing a gouge. User intervention is then required to make the leads fit.</p>
<p><b>Discard passes</b> - Discards any passes that cannot be reached with the given settings. This option leaves rest material for any following operations.</p>
<p><b>Move lead</b> - Moves the lead position to a different location along the part until there is room, but keeps the lead as specified.</p>
<p><b>Turn lead</b> - Changes the lead angle until there is room.</p>
<p><b>Retract lead</b> - Is the most automatic lead mode and also the default setting. It allows linking of all parts and, in some cases, does radial retracts when there is no other alternative. This is the recommended setting.</p>
