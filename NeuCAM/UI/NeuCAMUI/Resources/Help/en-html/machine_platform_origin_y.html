<div id="machine_platform_origin_y"><p>Platform origins, bed offsets, and similar concepts are used to tell Fusion 360 what position the target machine considers as zero along the three cardinal axes.
Usually, machines take zero as the central (X, Y), bottom-most (Z) point, but some machines may count from the farthest left corner, for example. <b>In such cases, use these fields to move the zero point from the default center-bottom position.</b></p>
