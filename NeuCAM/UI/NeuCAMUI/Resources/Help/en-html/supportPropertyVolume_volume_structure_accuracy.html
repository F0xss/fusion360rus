<div id="supportPropertyVolume_volume_structure_accuracy"><p>Adjusts the resolution of the supporting structure's contour below the body's face.</p>
<p>For a body with a detailed supported face, a lower smoothing distance means a higher sampling and therefore a more accurate representation of the face. This creates a support structure contour that more closely follows the supported face, creating a better support-to-body connection. However, smaller values can cause longer calculation times and higher memory usage. The value must be between 0.1 mm and 10 mm.</p>
