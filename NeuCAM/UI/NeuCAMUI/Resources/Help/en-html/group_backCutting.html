<div id="group_backCutting"><p>For tools with special geometry where chip thinning control is important. This activates additional controls to set the <b>Entry Radius</b> blend and <b>Exit Distance</b>.</p>
<p>Only available when the Cycle type is set to <b>Back cutting</b>.</p>

<p>Starting the toolpath closest to the chuck side, the Radius blends onto the cut and feeds in the positive direction. At a distance before the end of the cut, the feedrate is reduced to prevent chipping of the part or the tool.</p>
