<div id="workOrder"><p>Specifies the ordering of the individual operations in this setup in the NC code.</p>
<p>Preserve Order – orders the operations according to the layout of the toolpaths that you have generated, and processes the operations setup by setup.</p>
<p>Order by Operation – switches between the multiple offsets, performing each operation on each setup before continuing to the next operation.</p>
<p>Order by Tool – orders the operations by loading a tool and completing all the operations for that tool in each setup before continuing to the next tool.</p>
