<div id="propagateDiameter"><p>Check this to automatically select all holes with the same diameter as the hole currently selected in the selection box.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>: To drill a single 6mm / 1/4" hole and all 12mm / 1/2" holes, first select the 6mm / 1/4" hole, then select one of the 12mm / 1/2" holes, and then check the <b>Select same diameter</b> option.</p>
<p>Using this option is associative to the model, so if additional holes with the same diameter are added later, regenerating the operation automatically includes the added holes in the drilling cycle.</p>
