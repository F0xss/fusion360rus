<div id="optimizeOrientationRankingBoundingBoxVolume"><p>Determines the importance of having a small bounding box volume. The bounding box is always calculated parallel to the cardinal axes; so, this value can vary with the component's rotation around the Z axis even when the component's actual size remains unchanged.</p>
