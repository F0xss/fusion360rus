<div id="useCycle"><p>Enable to output the roughing as a canned cycle for your control.</p>
<p>This can reduce the amount of code generated for the NC program. It will also limit some of the advanced options for the Profile Roughing toolpath, since most canned cycles only create a basic boundary cut.</p>
<p>Note: This may require postprocessor modifications specific to your machine control.</p>
