<div id="optimizeOrientationSmallestRotation"><p>Viable orientations might be found, rotationally, in close proximity. Use this setting to reduce the number of results to the most relevant ones: If multiple viable orientations are found up to this rotational angle apart, the best one is selected and the other ones discarded. Smaller values significantly increase the calculation time and the amount of results presented.</p>
<p>Value should be between 5 and 180 degrees.</p>
