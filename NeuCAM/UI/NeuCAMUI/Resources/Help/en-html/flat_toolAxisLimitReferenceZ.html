<div id="flat_toolAxisLimitReferenceZ"><p>Specifies what reference when setting the tool's tilting angles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup Z axis - Sets the tilt angles using the Z axis of the setup.</li>
<li>Tool Orientation Z axis - Sets the tilt angles using the Z axis of the tool orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Z axis is vertical, then all horizontal areas with respect to it are at a 0 degree inclination.</p>
<p>Tip: In scenarios where you change the tool orientation to machine flat areas that are slightly inclined, you can use the Setup Z to set the tilt angle limits so that you can contain the toolpath to predictable regions.</p>
