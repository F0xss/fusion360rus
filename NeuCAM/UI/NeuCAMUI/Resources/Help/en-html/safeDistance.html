<div id="safeDistance"><p>Sets the minimum distance between the tool and the part's surfaces during retract moves. Within this distance, the tool retracts with a direct move, instead of a rapid move.</p>
<p>To retract the tool from the part with a rapid move, reduce the Safe Distance value. The distance is measured after stock to leave is applied. If a negative stock to leave is used, make sure that safe distance is large enough to prevent any collisions.</p>
