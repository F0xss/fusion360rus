<div id="manualInspect_measureMethod"><p>Specifies how you want to measure the center-to-center distance between two holes or bosses, or the surface-to-center distance between a flat surface and a hole or boss.</p>
<p>If your measuring instrument supports the measurement of center-to-center and surface-to-center distances, choose Direct. But if your measuring instrument does not directly support such measurement, choose From Maximum Distance or From Minimum Distance. This enables Fusion 360 to calculates the distance using other measurements.</p>
