<div id="supportPropertyBar_bar_distance_mesh"><p>Sets the distance between part and support. A negative value will make supports intrude into the part mesh. When you also choose a custom bar contour, you can use this in conjunction with <em>Angle at top</em> to achieve a calculated contact patch, for instance. To calculate the appropriate value, use this simple trigonometry formula:</p>
<p>Distance to part (negative) = (desired spot diameter - Width on end) * (Breaking point width - Width on end) / Height on end</p>
<p>Value should be between -3 and 3 mm.</p>
