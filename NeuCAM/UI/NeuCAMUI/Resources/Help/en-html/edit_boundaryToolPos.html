<div id="edit_boundaryToolPos"><p>Controls the extent to which a toolpath is trimmed based on its boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Tool center on boundary - Trims the toolpath such that the center of the tool can be on the boundary. This setting ensures that the entire surface inside the boundary is machined. However, areas outside the boundary might also be machined.</p>
<p>Tool inside of boundary - Trims the toolpath such that the entire tool stays inside the boundary. As a result, the entire surface contained by the boundary might not be machined.</p>
<p>Tool outside of boundary - Trims the toolpath such that the tool edge can move on the outside edge of the boundary.</p>
