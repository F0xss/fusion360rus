<div id="boundaryOverlap"><p>When using slope confinement and/or rest machining for a Scallop operation, you can enable the <b>Machine Areas Using Boundaries</b> check box to start offsetting the toolpath from the boundaries created by the slope and/or rest material detection.</p>
<p>You can specify a boundary overlap so that the boundary of the detected slope range or rest area is extended by the specified overlap amount.</p>
