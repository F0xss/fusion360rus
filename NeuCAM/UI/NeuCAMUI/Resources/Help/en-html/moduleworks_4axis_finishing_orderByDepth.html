<div id="moduleworks_4axis_finishing_orderByDepth"><p>Performs all the possible cutting moves at one depth before stepping down to machine at the next depth.</p>
<p>Useful in the case where you have two pockets divided by a small rib. If you machine an entire pocket and then proceed to machine the next pocket, there is no support for the rib and it may deflect as the tool machines closeby to it.</p>

<p>Machining both pockets at the same time at set depths means that the rib is supported by material on either side and is less likely to deflect.</p>

<p>Note: Generally, ordering by depth increases the total machining time.</p>
