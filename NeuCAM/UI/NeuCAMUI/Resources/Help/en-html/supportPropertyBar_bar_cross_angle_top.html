<div id="supportPropertyBar_bar_cross_angle_top"><p>When set beyond 0, a pointy end is added to the normally blunt end that terminates evenly in the part surface.</p>
<p>Note: This point intrudes into the part mesh, so you may want to also work with Distance to part to reduce or avoid unwanted duplication of toolpath at the intersection.</p>
<p>Value should be between 0.0 and 60 degrees.</p>
