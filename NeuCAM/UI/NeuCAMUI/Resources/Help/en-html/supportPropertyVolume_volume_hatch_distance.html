<div id="supportPropertyVolume_volume_hatch_distance"><p>Defines the distance between the raster's grid lines. This affects the number of created lines and the density.</p>
<p>A smaller hatch distance leads to denser, and therefore stronger, support structures. Keep in mind that denser support structures are harder to remove. Hatch Distance is not available when the Filling Type is Hollow.</p>
