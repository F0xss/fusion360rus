<div id="steepRestStrategy"><p>Specifies the type of passes to use for steep areas.</p>
<p><b>Along</b> - Passes run along the direction of the rest material. For example, if you are machining an internal corner, the passes will run along the internal corner.</p>
<ul>
<li>With maximum stepover - The stepover adjusts itself to always remain within the rest material area, so that the surface finish of the surrounding area is not affected. The maximum stepover occurs at the widest part of the rest material. If the rest material narrows down, the stepovers move closer together, leaving less material to cut on each stepover and potentially causing the tool to rub on the part.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>With constant stepover - A constant stepover is maintained throughout the rest material area so that you get a constant chip thickness, meaning better cutting conditions. If the rest material narrows down, the outermost passes may encroach the surrounding area that is already machined, potentially causing marks to the surface finish.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Across</b> - Passes run across the direction of the rest material. For example, if you are machining an internal corner, the passes will run across the internal corner.</p>
