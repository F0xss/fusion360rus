<div id="additive_configuration_select"><p>Opens the Print Setting Library where you select which print setting to use with the selected additive machine.</p>
<p>A print setting is a grouping of material-specific parameters, such as layer height, that you associate with an additive machine, and it defines how a part is additively manufactured. In the Print Setting Library, you can create, edit, copy and paste, and import and export print settings for additive machines. A print setting must be chosen before you can create the additive setup.</p>
