<p>Cutting with a feed per tooth based on the tool manufacturer's recommendations helps remove material at an efficient rate. A feed per tooth that is too high can lead to tool breakage. A feed per tooth that is too low can cause excess vibrations and dull the sharp edges of the tool. Â Fusion 360 uses the feed per tooth, the number of teeth the tool has, and the spindle speed to calculate the cutting feedrate.</p>
