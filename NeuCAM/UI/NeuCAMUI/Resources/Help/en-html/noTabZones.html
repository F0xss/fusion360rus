<div id="noTabZones"><p>Specifies zones on the part where tabs can't be placed automatically.</p>
<p>Click two points on the profile of the part to specify a no tab zone. The shortest distance between the two points becomes the no tab zone. If necessary, no tab zones can overlap with each other.</p>
<table class="tipTable" cellspacing="10">

<p>Having tabs on a part can mean that further work, such as grinding, sanding, or filing is required to clean up the part. As an example, you can use the no tab zones to specify areas where you don't want any tabs to be placed as certain geometry can make it difficult to perform the necessary clean-up work afterwards.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> If a tab is placed automatically in an area that is undesired, you can specify that area as a no tab zone so that no tab is placed. Instead, you can manually place a tab in that area, and then manually adjust the position of the tab slightly to a more desired area.</p>
