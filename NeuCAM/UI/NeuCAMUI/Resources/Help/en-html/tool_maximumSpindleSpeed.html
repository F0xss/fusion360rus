<div id="tool_maximumSpindleSpeed"><p>Specifies the maximum spindle speed limit when Constant Surface Speed is used.</p>
<p>With CSS, the spindle speed increases as the tool gets closer to the spindle centerline. This limits the RPM to keep large, potentially out of balance parts, from being thrown out of the chuck.</p>
