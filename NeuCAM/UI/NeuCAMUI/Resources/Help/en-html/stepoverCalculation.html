<div id="stepoverCalculation"><p>Determines how to calculate the stepover of the toolpath.</p>
<p><b>On surface</b> - Uses the surface of the model to calculate the stepover. This option can detect and machine undercuts.</p>
<p><b>From tip of tool</b> - Considers the tool's cutting geomtry when calculating the stepover. This option is useful for machining areas where the tool cannot contact all the points on a surface because of the shape of its cutting geometry. For example, an area where the internal corner radius is smaller than the tool's radius.</p>
<p>Using this option lets you use the <b>Spiral</b> option for continuous machining.</p>
<p><b>Note: From tip of tool</b> is not suitable for machining undercuts.</p>
