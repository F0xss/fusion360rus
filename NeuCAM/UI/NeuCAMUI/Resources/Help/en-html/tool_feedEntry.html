<p>To help maintain a short machine cycle time, it is recommended that the lead-in feedrate is the same as the cutting feedrate. The lead-in feedrate can be lowered for safer cutting conditions in scenarios where there is a heavy depth of cut, or if there is very little entry clearance, such as a tight gap between a tool and the walls of a pocket.</p>
