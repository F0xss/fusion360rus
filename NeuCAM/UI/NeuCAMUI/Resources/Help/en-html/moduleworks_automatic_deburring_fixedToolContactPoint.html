<div id="moduleworks_automatic_deburring_fixedToolContactPoint"><p>Uses a fixed point along the tool's flute for cutting.</p>
<p>Useful for using a point on the tool that has experienced the least wear for optimal cutting conditions.</p>
<p>For tools such as conical tools, using a point closer to the holder of the tool provides a larger effective cutting diameter. Using a point further up in the tool may provide better cutting conditions, however it will also make the tool stick out a lot more, making some areas unreachable.</p>
