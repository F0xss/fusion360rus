<div id="minimumAxialEngagement"><p>Specifies the minimum length of the tool's flute that should be engaged with each cutting move.</p>
<p>Useful for engaging with sufficient material. The tool could experience excessive vibrations if it does not have sufficient material to engage with when cutting.</p>
<p>In the example below, the tool performs a cut at a large depth and then performs finer-step moves in the upwards direction. With no minimum axial engagement limit, all the finer-step moves are machined.</p>

<p>With a <b>Minimum Axial Engagement</b> of 1 mm, any cutting move that causes the tool to engage with less than 1 mm on its flute is removed. The remaining material can be machined with a future operation that engages with more of the stock.</p>
