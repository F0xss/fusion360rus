<div id="probe_tool_wear_minimum_update_threshold"><p>Specifies the smallest deviation in the tool, above which tool-wear compensation is updated.</p>
<p>Enter a positive value. For example, a value of 0.05 mm means that the tool wear is updated only when the tool's deviation is 0.05 mm or more. A value of zero always updates the compensation.</p>
