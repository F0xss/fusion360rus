<div id="machineRegions"><p>Determines if the model is treated as having only shallow areas, only steep areas, or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Steep and shallow - Recognizes the entire model as containing steep areas and shallow areas. A threshold angle determines which areas are steep and which are shallow.</p>
<p>Shallow only – Recognizes the entire model as containing shallow areas, which lets you create a Parallel or Scallop toolpath, and access additional features such as the ability to optimize perpendicular passes.</p>
<p>Steep only – Recognizes the entire model as containing steep areas, which lets you create a Contour toolpath, and access additional features such as the ability to machine undercuts.</p>
