<div id="increment_component"><p>Separates the results in the report using an incremented numbering system. It increments the part number in the results while resetting the feature number. This is useful when probing the same geometric feature on multiple parts.</p>
<p>When deselected, the feature number is incremented but not the part number. This is useful when probing multiple geometric features on a single part. These functions depend on the abilities of the post processor and the machine's probing cycle macros.</p>
