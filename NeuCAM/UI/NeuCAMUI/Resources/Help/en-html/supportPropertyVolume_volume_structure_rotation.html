<div id="supportPropertyVolume_volume_structure_rotation"><p>Specifies the rotation angle for the support raster. The value should be between 0 and 90 degrees.</p>
<p>Rotating the support raster is necessary to minimize the contact between the support and the recoater blade for some additive processes. Having the support raster oriented parallel to the recoater blade can lead to build or machine damage and should be avoided by rotating the raster at a slight angle.</p>
