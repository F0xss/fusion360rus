<div id="machine_tcp"><p>Used for machines with rotary axis configurations.</p>
<p>When disabled, the part placement on the physical machine must match the part placement in Fusion.</p>
<p>When enabled, this outputs a function that allows the machine controller to remap the program, if the part is located off center from where it was programmed in Fusion.</p>
<p>Note: Enabling this function requires your machine control to have TCP capability. Contact your machine tool representative to verify this capability.</p>
