<div id="manualInspect_type"><p>Specifies the type of inspection to conduct on the physical part. You can choose from Distance, Pass/Fail, or Text.</p>
<p>Distance lets you measure the diameters of holes and bosses and certain distances, such as the distance between two holes or bosses, the distance between parallel surfaces, and the distance between a surface and a hole or boss. Pass/Fail lets you include a check, which does not have to be directly associated with a feature. And Text lets you specify a user-defined comment for when you want the inspector to record their observations.</p>
