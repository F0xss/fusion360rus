<p><b>Climb vs. Conventional Milling</b></p>
<p>Milling tools advance through the material so that the cutting flutes engage the material at maximum thickness and then decreases to zero. This is called Climb Milling.</p>
<p>Cutting in the opposite direction causes the tool to scoop up the material, starting at zero thickness and increasing to maximum.  This is called Conventional Milling.</p>
<p>Conventional milling is used often on manual machines because backlash in the machine lead screws causes the tool to lurch when climb cutting. This is not a problem on CNC machines because they use ball screws.</p>
<p>Conventional milling causes the tool to rub against the cutting surface, work hardening the material, generating heat, and increasing tool wear. Raking chips across the finished surface also produces a poorer surface finish.</p>
<p>Unless specifically recommended by the tool manufacturer for the material being milled, always use climb milling on a CNC. Climb milling produces far less cutting pressure and heat, leaves a better surface finish, and results in longer tool life.</p>
<p>Note: When working with brittle materials, like acrylics, climb milling may be used so material does not "blow out" along edges.</p>
