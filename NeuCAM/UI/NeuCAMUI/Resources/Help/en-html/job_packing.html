<div id="job_packing"><p>Automatically places bodies onto the build platform of your selected machine.</p>
<p>A single body is placed in the center of the build platform. Multiple bodies are placed so that they do not intersect each other. If multiple bodies cannot all be placed on the build platform, some are placed outside of the build platform and colored red to show that they lie outside the build volume.</p>
