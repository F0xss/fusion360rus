<p><b>Climb vs. Conventional Milling</b></p>
<p>Climb milling can be thought of as the cutter <em>rolling along</em> the surface that it is cutting. This generally gives a better finish in most metals, but requires good machine rigidity. Using this method, chips start at maximum thickness and get thinner towards the end of the cut, meaning more heat in the chip and less in the part.</p>
<p>With conventional milling, the cutter is <em>rotating away</em> from the surface it is cutting. This method is more commonly used with manual or less rigid machines. It does have some advantages, and can even give a better finish when machining certain materials including some woods.</p>
