<div id="group_supports_bar_pad"><p>Adds a wider section of bar where the bar meets the build platform.</p>
<p>The wider section improves bar connection to the build platform as well as bar sturdiness. For a pad to be generated, the Pad Height must be less than 40% of the total height of the supports. For example, if the total height of the supports is 50 mm, the height of the pads must be less than 20 mm.</p>
