<div id="additive_feature_simulation_split_surrogates"><p>Applies a different volume fraction to different support structures in the 3MF file for process simulation.</p>
<p>The 3MF file contains two support meshes for each body. The first is the real support mesh as seen in the software, and the second is a substitute support mesh for process simulation only. Deselect the checkbox to apply a uniform volume fraction for all substitute meshes. For example, when you are using the same style of support structures or the same style with slightly different settings.</p>
