<p>Note: When a profile is cut, it is possible for the remaining slug to tilt up. If you force the head to stay down, it is possible for this slug to damage the head of the machine. With the parameters below, you can keep the head down, but set a condition where the rapid motion will avoid any place a contour has already been cut.</p>
