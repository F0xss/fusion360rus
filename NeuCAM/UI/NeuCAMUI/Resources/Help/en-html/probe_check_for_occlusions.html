<div id="probe_check_for_occlusions"><p>Deselects any holes or bosses of the same diameter that cannot be probed because of the current tool orientation. These holes or bosses are not included in the probing cycle.</p>
<p>For example, if a hole is on the underside of a part and the probe cannot reach it, the hole is not probed.</p>
