<div id="processSimAutoCalculate"><p>Specifies whether the volume fraction for homogenized support structures is manually, or automatically, set.</p>
<p>Select to use an automatic volume fraction.</p>
<p>Deselect to manually set a volume fraction.</p>
<p>Lattice-type support structures are homogenized rather than meshed directly. Homogenization creates a volumetric representation, scaling the material properties by an automatically calculated volume fraction. The volume fraction is the ratio of the actual support volume over the homogenized volume.</p>
