<div id="thresholdAngle"><p>The angle measured from the horizontal plane that sets the division between the Shallow areas and the Steep areas of the model.</p>
<p>Steep areas with slopes larger than the angle use a Contour style toolpath. Shallow areas with slopes smaller than the angle use Parallel or Scallop style toolpaths. This is the divider between near flat machining surfaces and side machining surfaces.</p>
