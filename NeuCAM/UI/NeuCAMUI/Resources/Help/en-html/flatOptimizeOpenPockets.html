<div id="flatOptimizeOpenPockets"><p>Gives the tool more freedom to approach a part from the open sides of a pocket. This results in more efficient entry moves such as a short tangential extension instead of a ramp move, and better cutting conditions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing cuts that take place with the full-width of the tool.</li>
<li>Reducing sharp corners in the toolpath.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deselected, the tool is restricted from entering from the outside of a part, which is useful when you want to avoid any clamps or fixtures that are in the way. There are also less tool-lifts, which makes it faster for machining softer materials like foam, where the cutting conditions are not as critical.</p>
