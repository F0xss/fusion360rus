<div id="restMaterialAdjustment"><p>Adjusts the toolpath to either include or exclude cusps, which are small amounts of unmachined material.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use as computed - Uses the toolpath as computed without making any adjustments if no Adjustment Offset value is specified.</li>
<li>Ignore cusps - Ensures that small amounts of unmachined material are not included in the toolpath. Useful when there is negligible benefit in machining the small cusps when considering the added machining time. Used in combination with an Adjustment Offset value.</li>
<li>Machine cusps - Ensures that small amounts of unmachined material are included in the toolpath. Used in combination with an Adjustment Offset value.</li>
