<div id="probe_select_same_diameter"><p>Selects all the holes and bosses that have the same diameter as the currently selected hole or boss. For example, selecting a single 15 mm diameter hole automatically selects three other holes with the same diameter.</p>
<p>If you multiselect holes or bosses of different diameters, all holes or bosses of those diameters are selected. If holes or bosses with the same diameter are added later, regenerating the operation automatically includes the added holes or bosses in the probing cycle.</p>
