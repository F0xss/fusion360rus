<div id="supportPropertyBar_bar_pad_slope"><p>Specifies the angle of the taper from the pad to the bar support.</p>
<p>The angle is measured from the horizontal. Enter a value between -60 degrees and 60 degrees. Depending on the type of additive machine selected in the setup, you might want a negative or a positive taper. For example, for SLM (selective laser melting), a negative taper can mean that the supports are easier to remove from the build platform when using a tool, such as a scraper.</p>
