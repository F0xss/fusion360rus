<div id="smoothingFilterTolerance"><p>Specifies the smoothing tolerance.</p>
<p>Smoothing works best when the tolerance (the accuracy with which the original linearized path is generated) is equal to or greater than the Smoothing (line arc fitting) tolerance.</p>
<p>Note: Total tolerance, or the distance the toolpath can stray from the ideal spline or surface shape, is the sum of the cut Tolerance and Smoothing Tolerance. For example, setting a cut Tolerance of .0004 in. and Smoothing Tolerance of .0004 in. means the toolpath can vary from the original spline or surface by as much as .0008 in. from the ideal path.</p>
