<div id="supportPropertyStructure_structure_thickening_bottom"><p>Applies a different thickness to the bottom connections of a support structure compared to the main structure.</p>
<p>Bottom Connections refers to the interface between a support structure and a body below it. There are different connection types, which can be set in the Connections tab. A larger thickness makes for a stronger connection to the part, but in turn makes it harder to remove the support structure.</p>
