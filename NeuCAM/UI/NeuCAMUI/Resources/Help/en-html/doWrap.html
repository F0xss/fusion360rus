<div id="doWrap"><p>Wraps the toolpath around a cylinder to machine enclosed cylindrical surfaces. Useful for machining areas that are unreachable with 3-axis machining.</p>
<p>Set the WCS (Work Coordinate System) to correspond to the rotary axis on your machine tool. For example, if the machine has an A rotary axis, then the X axis of the WCS needs to run along the part in the setup. The resulting toolpath can be output using axis substitution around a rotary axis, which means machining with the X, A, and Z axes (with the A axis replacing the Y axis), or can be output as full multi-axis moves.</p>
