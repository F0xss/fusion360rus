<ul>
<li><b>No contact</b> - Sidesteps are not connected with each other on the same Z-level, but connected with a retract move.</li>
<li><b>Straight line</b> - Simpler, direct connections using straight lines.</li>
<li><b>Shortest path</b> - The shortest possible path between machining areas - typically a move in a straight line.</li>
<li><b>Smooth</b> - Use smooth tangential movements using true arcs where appropriate.</li>
</ul>
