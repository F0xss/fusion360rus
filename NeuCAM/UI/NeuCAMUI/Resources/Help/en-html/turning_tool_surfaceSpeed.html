<div id="turning_tool_surfaceSpeed"><p>Specifies the speed of the material as it moves past the cutting tip of the tool. The surface speed is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece's surface per unit of time.</p>
<p>Cutting with a surface speed based on the tool manufacturer's recommendations helps reduce tool wear. Fusion 360 uses the surface speed and the tool diameter to calculate the spindle speed.</p>
