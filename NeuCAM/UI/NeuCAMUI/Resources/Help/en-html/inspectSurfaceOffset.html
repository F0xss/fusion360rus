<div id="inspectSurfaceOffset"><p>Specifies the positive or negative distance from the surface of the model, from which contact points are measured.</p>
<p>This compensates for known differences between the thickness of the part and the model. The offset is applied normal to the surface at the contact point, with positive values in the direction of the probe.</p>
