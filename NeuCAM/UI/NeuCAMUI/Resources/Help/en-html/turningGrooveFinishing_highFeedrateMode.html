<div id="turningGrooveFinishing_highFeedrateMode"><p>Specifies when rapid movements should be output as true rapids (G0) and when as high feedrate movements (G1).</p>
<p><b>Preserve rapid movement</b> - Preserves all rapid movements.</p>
<p><b>Always use high feed</b> - Outputs rapid movements as (high feed moves) G01 moves instead of rapid movements (G0).</p>
<p>This parameter is usually set to avoid collisions at rapids on machines which perform "dogleg" movements at rapid.</p>
