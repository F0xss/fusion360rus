<li>Strip: A continuous band connecting to the part all along its upper edge</li>
<li>Trapoid: Triangles with truncated tips</li>
<li>Breaking points: Like trapoid, but with another, inverted row of trapoids stacked on top, forming X-shaped connections</li>
<li>Triangles: Triangles that simply terminate in pointy tips, for very delicate support attachment</li>
