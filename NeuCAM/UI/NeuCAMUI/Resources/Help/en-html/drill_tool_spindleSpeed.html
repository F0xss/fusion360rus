<p>Drilling with a spindle speed that is determined by using the tool manufacturer's recommendations helps ensure a good surface finish for your holes. You can enter a spindle speed manually, or let Fusion 360 calculate the spindle speed when you enter a value for the Surface Speed.</p>
<p>Note: You may want to reduce the spindle speed depending on if you have a low-powered machine, lack of coolant, or clamping fixtures that have low clamping pressure.</p>
