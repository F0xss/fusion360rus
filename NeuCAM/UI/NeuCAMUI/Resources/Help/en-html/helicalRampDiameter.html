<div id="helicalRampDiameter"><p>The maximum diameter to use for a helical entry into the cavity.</p>
<p>An optimal value causes the tool to overlap its center, while still creating the maximum helical bore for the entry into the cavity. The goal is for good chip evacuation. If the value is bigger than the diameter of the tool it can leave a boss standing in the center of the helix.</p>

<p>The system will determine the best location for the entry helix, unless and Entry Position is selected. (Entry Positions shown below). The complete area will always be cleared, regardless of the diameter.
Note: The area width should be Tool Dia + Ramp Dia + Stock, or the helical entry will fail.</p>
