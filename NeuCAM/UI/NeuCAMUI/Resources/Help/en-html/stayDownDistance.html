<div id="stayDownDistance"><p>Many toolpaths will make a cut and reposition for the next cut. If the distance between positions is greater than the Maximum Stay Down value, the tool will retract between cuts. To keep the tool down between cuts, set this value greater than the longest reposition distance.</p>
<p>In the part shown the widest point is 1.8".</p>

<p>Note: Regardless of the stay-down distance, the tool retracts between passes if the rapid motion violates the workpiece.</p>
