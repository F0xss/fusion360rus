<div id="jet2d_cuttingMode"><p>Use this for machines that have internal <b>Quality</b> tables to<br>
set the appropriate cutting feeds for the material being cut.</p>
<p>* <b>Through - Auto</b><br>
* <b>Through - high quality</b><br>
* <b>Through - medium quality</b><br>
* <b>Through - low quality</b><br>
* <b>Etch</b><br>
* <b>Vaporize</b><br></p>
<p>Note: Etch scores the material surface without cutting thru.<br>
Vaporize is used for burning the plastic film off of some materials.<br>
Some of these options are not available for all machine types.<br>
Example: You cannot Etch with a Plasma cutter.<br></p>
