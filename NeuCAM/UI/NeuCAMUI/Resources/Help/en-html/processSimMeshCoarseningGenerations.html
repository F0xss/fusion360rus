<div id="processSimMeshCoarseningGenerations"><p>The maximum number of times that the elements of the mesh are coarsened at, and immediately below, the current deposition layer.</p>
<p>Enter a value between 0 and 6. The higher the value, the coarser the mesh. The value must be less than, or equal to, the Max Adaptivity Level.</p>
<p>Coarsening is the combining of smaller elements in areas where there is low detail. If the geometry is not suitable to coarsening, the mesh is not adapted. Elements representing fine detail in critical areas is determined by the number of Layers per Element.</p>
