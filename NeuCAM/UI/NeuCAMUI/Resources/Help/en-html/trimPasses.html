<div id="trimPasses"><p>Enable this to allow the passes to be trimmed back to fit the leads, where otherwise not possible, to allow the CNC machining to maintain a high feed.
If disabled, forces the entire pass to be machined. This can result in sharp moves and the minimum corner radius may not be respected.</p>
