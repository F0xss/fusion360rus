<div id="processSimMeshMaxAdaptivityLevel"><p>The maximum number of times that the elements of the mesh are coarsened away from the deposition area and within the build platform.</p>
<p>Enter a value between 0 and 6. The higher the value, the coarser the mesh. A value of 0 coarsens only the top layer of the build platform.</p>
<p>Coarsening is the combining of smaller elements in areas where there is low detail. If the geometry is not suitable to coarsening, the mesh is not adapted.</p>
