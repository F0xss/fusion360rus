<p><b>Selected pockets</b> - Use this option when you are machining a part with low complexity that has only a few pockets.</p>

<p><b>Pocket recognition</b> - Use this option when you are machining a complex part that has numerous pockets, which also vary in size. Pocket recognition can save you time by automatically selecting pockets based on their geometry. Specify the geometry limits based on your tool's geometry.</p>

<p>Note: During pocket recognition, only closed pockets are considered. The closed pockets are selected by their edges, and not their faces.</p>
