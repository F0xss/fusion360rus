<div id="tool_useConstantSurfaceSpeed"><p>Select to control the RPM based on how fast the material should move across the cutting edge of the tool.</p>
<p>Engages a machine function that changes the RPM of the spindle based on the current cutting diameter. The RPM increases as the cutting tool tip moves closer to the part centerline. This keeps a consistent amount of material moving past the tool tip during the cut.</p>
<p>When deselected the machine will use a constant spindle speed.</p>
