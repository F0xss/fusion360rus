<p>Following the tool manufacturer's recommendations for feeds and speeds helps to remove material at an efficient rate and ensure a longer tool life. With the material information of the tool and the stock, consult the tool manufacturer's manual for the recommended surface speed and feed per tooth, which Fusion 360 uses to determine the feeds and speeds.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Some tool manufacturers provide the actual feeds and speeds, which you can enter directly.</p>
