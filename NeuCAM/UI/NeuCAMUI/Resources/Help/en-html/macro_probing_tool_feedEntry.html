<div id="macro_probing_tool_feedEntry"><p>Defines the speed of the probe during lead moves, which are performed before and after the probe touches the part. Lead moves are displayed in green in the canvas.</p>
<p>If the probe is set up to perform two touches, the first touch is at the Lead-In Feedrate and then the second touch is at the Measure Feedrate.</p>

<p>Note: Increasing Lead-In Feedrate does not change the accuracy of the measurements, as it does not affect the measure moves. However, the value can cause false triggers if the acceleration and deceleration of the machine is too high, triggering the probe.</p>
