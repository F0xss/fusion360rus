<div id="approachFromOutsideBack"><p>Allows the cutting moves to extend beyond the Back limit by the tool radius.</p>
<p>In most cases, there could be remaining stock or fixtures that are beyond the Back limit, which means you may want to restrict the tool from going beyond the Back limit for safety reasons.</p>
<p>Note: The Back limit is specified in the Geometry tab.</p>
