<div id="allowBackWallCut"><p>Allows the Lead-In and Lead-Out Radius/Length/Angle to move past the containment limits of the cut boundary. This might cause the toolpath to gouge the remaining stock.</p>
<p>When disabled, if the toolpath passes through the remaining stock, the toolpath is not generated.</p>
