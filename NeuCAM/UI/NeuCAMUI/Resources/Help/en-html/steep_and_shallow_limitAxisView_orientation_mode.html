<div id="steep_and_shallow_limitAxisView_orientation_mode"><p>Specifies the orientation of the rotary axis.</p>
<p>The <b>Orientation</b> drop-down menu provides the following options to set the orientation of your rotary axis:</p>
<p><b>Setup X Axis</b> - Uses the X axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis. As a result, the tool always points perpendicular to X.</p>
<p><b>Setup Y Axis</b> - Uses the Y axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis. As a result, the tool points perpendicular to Y.</p>
<p><b>Setup Z Axis</b> - Uses the Z axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis. As a result, the tool points perpendicular to Z.</p>
<p><b>Model orientation</b> - Uses the coordinate system (WCS) of the current part as the rotary axis.</p>
<p><b>Select rotary axis</b> - Select a plane to set the rotary axis perpendicular to. You can also select an edge to set the rotary axis parallel to.</p>
<p><b>Select coordinate system</b> - Sets a specific rotary axis orientation for this operation from a defined User Coordinate System (UCS) in the model. This uses both the origin and orientation of the existing coordinate system. Use this option if your model does not contain a suitable point and plane for your operation.</p>
