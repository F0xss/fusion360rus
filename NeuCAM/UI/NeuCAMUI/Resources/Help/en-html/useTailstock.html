<div id="useTailstock"><p>A tailstock is used to apply support to the longitudinal rotary axis of the workpiece being machined. This is particularly useful when the workpiece is relatively long and slender. Failing to use a tailstock can cause the workpiece to bend excessively while being cut and cause "chatter".</p>
<p>For this option to take effect, your machine needs a programmable tailstock and your post processor has to be configured to write the code your machine needs.</p>
<p>Once configured, you would typically see M21 (tailstock forward) at the beginning of the operation and M22 (tailstock backward) at the end with this option enabled.</p>
