<p>A smaller distance will cause the head to retract to the Clearance plane. A larger value allows you to stay down at the Top Height.</p>
<p>Note: In the first example, you can see how the rapid movement avoids any previously cut profiles. Smaller parts can tilt, which might cause a collision with the head. Moving around previously cut profiles eliminates the possibility of a crash.</p>
