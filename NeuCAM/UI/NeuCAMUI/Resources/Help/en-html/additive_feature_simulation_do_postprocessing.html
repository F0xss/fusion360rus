<div id="additive_feature_simulation_do_postprocessing"><p>Prepares the substitute mesh of the support structures in the 3MF file for process simulation.</p>
<p>The 3MF file contains two support meshes for each body. The first is the real support mesh as seen in the software, and the second is a substitute support mesh for process simulation only. If exporting the 3MF file fails, this might be because of the complexity of the substitute mesh. If this happens, deselect the checkbox, but be aware that you run the risk of the process simulation failing.</p>
