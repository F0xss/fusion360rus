<div id="group_supports_supportproperties_volume_general"><p>Determines the filling type and the intersection between body and supports.</p>
<p>The filling type allows you to switch between a hollow structure, which creates a solid block of material, and structured, which creates open supports that work better for different processes. With the distance settings you can define the connection strength between body and supports.</p>
