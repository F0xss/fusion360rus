<div id="useThinWall"><p>When milling part features with wall thicknesses comparable to sheet metal stock, or even thinner, the stock is subjected to the forces generated by metal removal. This can result in the delicate structure of thin walls moving relative to the tool, making it difficult to maintain dimensional accuracy and impart the specified surface finish.</p>
<p>This option can be used to reduce the vibration and chatter by ensuring that both sides of a thin wall are machined at the same time.</p>
