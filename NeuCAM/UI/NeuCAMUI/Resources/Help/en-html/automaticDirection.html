<div id="automaticDirection"><p>Automatically determines the most suitable direction for passes by taking into account the underlying flat region. Generally, this reduces the overall number of passes required.</p>
<p>A reduction in the number of passes means fewer entry or exit. The benefit of reducing the entry or exit moves is that you are more likely to keep to the estimated machining time.</p>
