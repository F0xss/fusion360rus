<div id="unclampMode"><p>Specifies which spindle chuck to open before returning the secondary spindle.</p>
<p><b>Keep Both Clamped</b> - If main spindle has bar loaded and sub spindle has the workpiece, both spindles are kept clamped to continue machining.</p>
<p><b>Unclamp Primary Spindle</b> - if the workpiece is a billet and the main and sub spindle are clamped on the part, the main spindle will need to be unclamped so the sub spindle can move with the part.</p>
<p><b>Unclamp Secondary Spindle</b> - If the sub spindle has been used for bar pulling or supporting the workpiece, the sub spindle can now return home without the workpiece.</p>
