<div id="job_workOffset_UI"><p>Specifies the number of the coordinate system on the machine controller. Fusion 360 passes this information to the post processor.</p>
<p>Note: The WCS Offset value starts at 0, which is the first work offset on the machine controller. For example, on a Fanuc-based machine, the post processor interprets 0 as using G54.</p>
