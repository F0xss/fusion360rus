<div id="doRoughingClearingPass"><p>Specifies that cusps left by the initial roughing passes should be cleared. Enable this setting to avoid the tool loading up with a greater than expected amount of material during the final profile pass. This can become particularly relevant with some geometries when cusps are left on the groove wall.</p>
