<div id="useEvenStepdowns"><p>Enable to create equal distances between machining passes.</p>
<p><b>Example</b>: Suppose you are machining a profile with a depth of 23 mm and a maximum stepdown = 10 mm.</p>
<p>With Use even stepdowns <b>enabled</b> - you get three passes with the first value at -7.666 mm, the second at -15.3333 mm, and the third at -23 mm.</p>
<p>With Use even stepdowns <b>disabled</b> - again you get three passes, the first at -10 mm, the second at -20 mm, and the third at -23 mm.</p>
