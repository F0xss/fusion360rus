<div id="orderBottomUp"><p>Contour passes are usually ordered from top to bottom. Enable this check box to specify that passes should be ordered bottom-up (bottom to top).</p>
<p>Ordering is done so that the passes with the smallest Z-level tool orientation are done first in one operation for multiple contours. This method is very useful for machining fragile materials like graphite.</p>
