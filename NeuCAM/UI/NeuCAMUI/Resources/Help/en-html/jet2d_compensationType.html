<div id="jet2d_compensationType"><p>Specifies the compensation type.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>In computer</b> - The head position is calculated by the program, based on the Kerf diameter and the Sideways Compensation direction. The post-processed output contains the actual compensated position to cut the part to size. <b>The Computer compensates for the width of the Kerf.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>In control</b> - The head position is output as the actual coordinates of the selected chain. Compensation is <em>not</em> calculated, but instead, compensation codes are output to allow the operator to set the offset amount at the machine tool control. <b>The Machine Control compensates for the width of the Kerf.</b></li>
</ul>
