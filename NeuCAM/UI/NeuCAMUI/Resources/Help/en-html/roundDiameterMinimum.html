<div id="roundDiameterMinimum"><p>Specifies the minimum diameter that holes and circular pockets need to have for them to be included in the selection.</p>
<p>The <b>Minimum corner radius</b> excludes holes and circular pockets that are not reachable by the tool, after which the <b>Minimum hole diameter</b> limit can be used to determine which holes or circular pockets you want to include in the selection.</p>
<p>In the example below, the hole in the top-left corner of the part is not included because its radius is smaller than the minimum corner radius limit.</p>
