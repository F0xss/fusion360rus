<div id="job_packingType"><p>Places all the selected components within the additive machineâ€™s build volume so that they do not intersect with each other.</p>
<p>If the setup is using an additive machine with FFF, SLA, or MPBF capabilities, you can arrange only in 2D, that is, on the build platform. If the setup is using an additive machine with MJF or SLS capabilities, you can arrange in 2D or 3D. For a component to fit inside the build volume, it must have at least 1 mm free space in its X, Y, and Z directions.</p>
