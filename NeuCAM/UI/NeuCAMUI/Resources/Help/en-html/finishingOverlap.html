<div id="finishingOverlap"><p>The finishing overlap is the distance that the tool passes beyond the entry point before leading out.</p>
<p>Specifying a <em>Finishing Overlap</em> ensures that the material at the entry point is properly cleared.</p>

<p>Note: The finishing overlap follows the selected contour, so it is safe to specify a large overlap.</p>
