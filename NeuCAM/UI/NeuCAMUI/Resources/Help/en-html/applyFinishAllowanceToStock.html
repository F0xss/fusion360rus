<div id="applyFinishAllowanceToStock"><p>When enabled, applies the finish allowance (defined by the <b>Stock to Leave</b>) to the stock in addition to the model. This means that the toolpath does not dip as it comes off the shoulder on a model. Instead, the toolpath continues in a straight line, leaving a finish allowance on the stock as well.</p>
<p>When disabled, the finish allowance is applied only to the model.</p>
