<div id="tool_library_tool_surfaceSpeed"><p>The speed of the cutting tip of the tool as it goes past the material. The surface speed is expressed in units of distance along the workpiece's surface per unit of time.</p>
<p>Cutting with a surface speed based on the tool manufacturer's recommendations helps reduce tool wear. Fusion 360 uses the surface speed and the cutting point diameter to calculate the spindle speed.</p>
