<div id="multiAxisContour_tiltTool"><p>Enables multi-axis tilting for the tool so that you can machine more areas and avoid potential collisions between the part and the tool assembly. The tool-axis tilting is determined by the specified tilt values.</p>

<p>Tool tilting can happen only on machines that allow multi-axis configurations. When using multi-axis tilting, it is particularly useful to machine with shorter tools that are more rigid for better surface finishes.</p>
