<div id="group_axislimits"><p>Specifies angular limitations of the machine tool, which limits the tilting angle of the tool while cutting a multi-axis toolpath.</p>
<p>Specify a minimum and maximum tilt angle to keep the tool axis within. You may want to limit the tool axis to not tilt beyond a certain angle to avoid colliding into, for example, something you have retrofitted inside your machine tool.</p>
