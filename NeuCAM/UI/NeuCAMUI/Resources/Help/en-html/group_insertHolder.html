<div id="group_insertHolder"><p>Specifies the clearance between the model and different sections of the turning tool, such as the holder or the insert.</p>
<p>The clearances take effect when machining undercut areas, such as grooves with areas that are unreachable by the tool, especially if the material in the groove was not removed previously through a roughing operation.</p>
