<div id="shallowOptimizeOpenPockets"><p>Gives the tool more freedom to approach a part from the open sides of a pocket, resulting in better cutting conditions, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing cuts that take place with the full-width of the tool for better tool life.</li>
<li>Reducing sharp corners in the toolpath, which result in fewer changes in direction, reducing potential dwell marks and improving the surface finish.</li>
</ul>
<p>When deselected, the tool does not enter from outside of the part, which is useful when you want to avoid any clamps or fixtures that are in the way. There are also less tool-lifts, which makes it faster for machining softer materials like foam, where the cutting conditions are not as critical.</p>
