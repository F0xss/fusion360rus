<div id="entryPositions"><p>Helps determine the positions where the tool should lead-in, which is the move before the beginning of a cutting move.</p>
<p>Select points on the model to determine the lead-in positions. You can select one position or multiple positions. If you select multiple positions, the position that is the closest to a contour gets used as the approximate lead-in position.</p>
