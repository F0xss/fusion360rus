<div id="group_supports_supportproperties_lattice_general"><p>The determined support volume is subdivided into unit cells which are then filled with lattice topology. From the scaffolding thus created, individual bars support the respective downskin clusters. If possible, and desired, whole groups of eight cells (2&times;2&times;2) are collapsed into single cells.</p>
