<div id="overrideModel"><p>Select to include in the toolpath calculation other bodies, faces, or surfaces, in addition to the geometry defined in the setup. Alternatively, you can override the model geometry defined in the setup and instead machine other bodies, faces, or surfaces.</p>
<p>A typical use of this option is to include capping surfaces that stop the milling tool from going into holes that will be manufactured by drilling operations later in the setup.</p>
