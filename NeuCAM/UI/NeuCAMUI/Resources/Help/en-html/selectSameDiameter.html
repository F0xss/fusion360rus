<div id="selectSameDiameter"><p>Selects all holes with the same diameter as the currently selected feature. For example, if you select a single 6-mm hole and a single 12-mm hole, every 6-mm and 12-mm hole on the part is automatically selected.</p>
<table class="tipTable" cellspacing="10">
<tr>
<td><center><img border="0" width="265" height="163" src="../images/Drill_SelectSameDiameterAll_bright3.png"/></center></td>
</tr><tr>
<td><center><p>A single selection can detect matching holes.</p></center></td>
</tr></table>
<p>Note: This option is associative to the model. If additional holes with the same diameter are added to the model, regenerating the operation automatically includes the new holes.</p>
