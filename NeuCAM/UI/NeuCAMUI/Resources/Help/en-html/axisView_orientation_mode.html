<p><b>Setup X Axis</b> - Uses the X axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis.</p>
<p><b>Setup Y Axis</b> - Uses the Y axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis.</p>
<p><b>Setup Z Axis</b> - Uses the Z axis of the workpiece coordinate system (WCS) of the current setup as the rotary axis.</p>
<p><b>Model orientation</b> - Uses the coordinate system (WCS) of the current part as the rotary axis.</p>
<p><b>Select rotary axis</b> - Select a flat face to set the rotary axis perpendicular to, or select a circular face to set the center of the face as the point the rotary axis runs through.</p>
<p><b>Select coordinate system</b> - Sets a specific rotary axis orientation for this operation from a defined User Coordinate System (UCS) in the model. This uses both the origin and orientation of the existing coordinate system. Use this option if your model does not contain a suitable point and plane for your operation.</p>
