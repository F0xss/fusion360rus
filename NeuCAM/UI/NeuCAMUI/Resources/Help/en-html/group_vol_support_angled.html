<div id="group_vol_support_angled"><p>Controls whether the supports between the selected faces, bodies, or components and the build platform are angled. When selected, the supports are angled towards a reference point, which is based on the origin of the model. When deselected, the supports extend vertically down.</p>
<p>Angling helps avoid generating supports that connect downskin regions with upskin regions. Supports are then easier to remove after the build process is complete and helps with the surface quality of parts. To adjust the position of the reference point, use the manipulator in the canvas or enter values directly in this dialog.</p>
