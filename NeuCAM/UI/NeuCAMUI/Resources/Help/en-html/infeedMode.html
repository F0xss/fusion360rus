<div id="infeedMode"><p>The infeed is the depth of cut per pass and is critical in threading. Each successive pass engages a larger portion of the cutting edge of the insert. There are three infeed mode options.</p>
<p><b>Constant infeed</b> - With this option, the cutting force and metal removal rate can increase dramatically from one pass to the next. <b>Example:</b> When producing a 60 degree thread form using a constant 0.010 inch infeed per pass, the second pass removes three times the amount of metal as the first pass. The amount of metal removed continues to grow exponentially with each subsequent pass.</p>
<p><b>Reduced infeed</b> - This option maintains more realistic cutting forces and reduces the depth of cut with each pass. Because it avoids the increased metal removal rate of constant infeed, it is the recommended setting.</p>
<p><b>Alternate infeed</b> - Similar to the Reduced infeed, but this method alternates between feeding in from the left and right sides of the thread profile.</p>
