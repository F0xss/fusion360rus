<div id="jet2d_preserveOrder"><p>When Selected, the chains/features are machined in the order they were selected.<br>
When unselected, the program optimizes the cut order.</p>
<p>As a default Waterjet toolpaths will always be optimized to machine inside bountaries first (slugs), then machine outside boundaries. This keeps the parts from breaking free and moving during a second or third cut on the same part.</p>
<p>Note: See the <b>Linking - Keep Nozzle Down</b> parameters for more control over the movement between inside cut slugs and outside cut parts.</p>
