<div id="supportLattice_bar_al_adaptive_step_count"><p>The rule of collapsing multiple fully intact lattice cells into the next larger cell size is applied up to this many times. Note that this is only the permissible maximum. If there aren't enough intact cells in a contiguous 2&times;2&times;2 arrangement, no collapsing is performed.</p>
<p>Value should be between 0 and 10.</p>
