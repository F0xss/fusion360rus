<div id="manualInspect_lowertolerance"><p>Specifies the lower limit of the tolerance band. The tolerance band is the acceptable amount of deviation relative to the nominal value.</p>
<p>If the recorded measurement is above or below the tolerance band, the item is considered out of tolerance. For example, an upper tolerance of 0.1 mm and a lower tolerance of -0.1 mm for 15 mm hole means that the diameter must be between 14.9 mm and 15.1 mm.</p>
