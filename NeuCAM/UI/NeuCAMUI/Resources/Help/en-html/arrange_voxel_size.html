<div id="arrange_voxel_size"><p>Specifies the edge length for the voxels, or elements, which are used to represent the components when calculating the arrangement.</p>
<p>The smaller the voxel size, the more accurately the shape of each component is represented, giving an arrangement that makes better use of the available space.</p>
<p>Note: Using a smaller voxel size can take longer to calculate the arrangement.</p>
