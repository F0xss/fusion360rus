<div id="supportCluster_cluster_duplicate"><p>Controls whether areas get supported multiple times, even when a previous support type has already been applied to that area.</p>
<p>By overlapping supported areas, and combining different support types, you can create reinforced support structures. For example, reinforcing volume supports with bar supports.</p>
