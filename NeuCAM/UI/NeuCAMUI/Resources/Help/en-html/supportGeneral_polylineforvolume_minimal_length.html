<div id="supportGeneral_polylineforvolume_minimal_length"><p>Sets the smallest length an edge can be for supports to be generated.</p>
<p>Any edge less than the specified value is ignored for support generation. This value should be at least 0.01 mm. The example here shows how a punched-plate polyline has been generated around the volume support for the two larger bodies, but not for the smaller one.</p>
