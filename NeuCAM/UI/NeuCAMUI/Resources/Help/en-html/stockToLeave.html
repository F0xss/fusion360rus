<div id="stockToLeave"><p>The radial stock to leave parameter controls the amount of material to leave in the radial (perpendicular to the tool axis) direction, that is, at the side of the tool.</p>

<p>Specifying a positive radial stock to leave results in material being left on the vertical walls and steep areas of the part.</p>
<p>For surfaces that are not exactly vertical, the program interpolates between the axial (floor) and radial stock to leave values, so the stock left in the radial direction on these surfaces might be different from the specified value, depending on surface slope and the axial stock to leave value.</p>
<p>Changing the radial stock to leave automatically sets the axial stock to leave to the same amount, unless you manually enter the axial stock to leave.</p>
<p>For finishing operations, the default value is 0 mm/0 in, that is, no material is left.</p>
<p>For roughing operations, the default is to leave a small amount of material that can then be removed later by one or more finishing operations.</p>
<p><b>Negative Stock to Leave</b></p>
<p>When using a negative stock to leave, the machining operation removes more material from your stock than your model shape. This can be used to machine electrodes with a <b>spark gap</b>, where the size of the spark gap is equal to the negative stock to leave.</p>
<p>Both the radial and axial stock to leave can be negative numbers. However, the negative radial stock to leave must be less than the tool radius.</p>
<p>When using a ball or radius cutter with a negative radial stock to leave that is greater than the corner radius, the negative axial stock to leave must be less than or equal to the corner radius.</p>
