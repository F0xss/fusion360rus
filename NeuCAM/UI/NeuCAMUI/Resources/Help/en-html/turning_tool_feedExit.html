<p>To help maintain a short machine cycle time, it is recommended that the lead-out feedrate is the same as the cutting feedrate. The lead-out feedrate can be increased in scenarios where a very low cutting feedrate is used. This helps the tool exit at a faster speed when its no longer engaged in a cut.</p>
