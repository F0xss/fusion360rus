<div id="useShortContourThreshold"><p>Avoids machining small areas to prevent damaging the tool or the part.</p>
<p>Useful for avoiding small pockets for example, particularly in cases where the tool is non-center cutting, which prevents you from plunging into the pocket, while there is also insufficient space to ramp into the pocket. This allows you to use a smaller tool in a future operation to machine the small area safely.</p>
