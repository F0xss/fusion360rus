<div id="outerRadius_mode"><p>Shown in Light Blue, sets the Outer radius reference position.  The reference can be in relation to the Stock, the Model, a specified Radius, Diameter, or any of the other Radial positions.  This reference position can be shifted with a positive or negative offset value.</p>
<p><b>Clearance</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the Clearance Position.</p>
<p><b>Retract</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the Retract position.</p>
<p><b>Stock OD</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the outside diameter of the defined Stock.</p>
<p><b>Model OD</b> - Sets the Outer radius  in reference to the outside diameter of the defined Model .</p>
<p><b>Outer radius</b> - Sets the Outer radius reference to the Outer radius position. The Clearance radius must be larger than the Outer radius. Use the Offset parameter to make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p><b>Inner radius</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the Inner radius position. The Clearance radius must be larger than the Inner radius. Use the Offset parameter to make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p><b>Model ID</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the inside diameter of the Model, as defined in the Setup. Use the Offset parameter to make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p><b>Stock ID</b> - Sets the Outer radius in reference to the inside diameter of the Stock, as defined in the Setup. Use the Offset parameter to make adjustments as needed.</p>
<p><b>Selection</b> - Select any face, vertex, or point on the model to define the Clearance radius. Use the Offset parameter to make positive or negative adjustments as needed.</p>
<p><b>Radius</b> - This option allows you to enter a radius value in the Offset field. This value is in reference to the centerline of the part and will not recognize any associative changes to the model.</p>
<p><b>Diameter</b> - This option allows you to enter a diameter value in the Offset field. This value is in reference to the centerline of the part and will not recognize any associative changes to the model.</p>
<p>Note: The Outer radius must be smaller than, or equal to, the Retract, but larger than the Inner radius, in order to generate a valid toolpath.</p>
