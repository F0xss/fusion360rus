<div id="toolAxisLimitReferenceZ"><p>Determines where the machine's angular limits are measured from.</p>
<ul>
<li>Setup Z - Sets the angular limits from the Z axis of the setup.</li>
<li>Tool Orientation - Sets the angular limits from the Z axis of the tool orientation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: In scenarios where you change the tool orientation to machine an area, you can use the Setup Z to set the tilt angle limits so that you can contain the toolpath to predictable regions.</p>
